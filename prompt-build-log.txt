# Prompt Build Log

This documents the prompts used to build this project with Claude.

---

## 1. User prompt
> let's build a super simple blackjack simiulator. Keep it simple w/ Vite, typescript. Render ascii cards. give the player simple controls to hit, hold, split. 

## 2. User prompt
> run it 

## 3. User prompt
> Let's add a side panel that guides the player. Here's the simple strategy we should follow. Using this, suggest the best next move for the player in the sidepanel. 

Strategy: 
The simplest strategy for blackjack (21):

**Always do this:**
- Hit on 8 or less
- Stand on 17 or more
- Double down on 11

**Against dealer 2-6 (weak):**
- Stand on 12-16
- Double down on 10

**Against dealer 7-A (strong):**
- Hit on 12-16

**Aces & 8s:** Always split
**10s & 5s:** Never split

That's enough to get you close to optimal play without memorizing full basic strategy charts.
